She joined the Coventry Women's Suffrage Society (CWSS) - a local branch  of the large and law abiding NUWSS - becoming its Honorary Secretary. Averal was also Honorary Secretary and committee member of another local society - the Coventry branch of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (now the RSPCA) organizing its competitions and entries for the city's May Day parade. As a law abiding suffragist, Averal complied with the government's 1911 census choosing not to take part in the suffragette boycott of the survey that year. In 1913, she wrote a series of articles exploring women's role in the politics of local government, published in the newspaper The Coventry Herald. Through her role in and with the help of the CWSS, Averal was central in founding the Tipperary Club in February 1915, located in the city's Old Palace Yard. The club provided all manner of help and support for the wives and mothers of local soldiers and sailors caught up in the First World War. Its services included invaluable free childcare facilities and health advice from Doctors, as well as providing reading material, refreshments and fortnightly entertainment for women and children. Averal's legacy via the Tipperary Club was felt for many years in Coventry. So positive was its impact on the local community during the 1914-18 War, that it was revived during the Second World War. Averal remained interested in expanding women's role in political life. When women finally got the vote on the same terms as men in 1928, Averal stood as a Labour candidate for Coventry City Council - narrowly missing out by 46 votes to the Conservative candidate. She had by then moved to Lion's House, Allesley, where she compiled a history of Old Allesley and was active in the local Women's Institute there (meetings were held at the Parish Rooms) among other parish work. Sadly, her contribution to local women's causes was cut short. Averal suffered an untimely death aged just 47 due to complications following an operation for appendicitis. Researcher: Tara Morton.
