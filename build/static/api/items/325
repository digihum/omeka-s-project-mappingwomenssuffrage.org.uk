The family was musical and literary: Dorothy\u2019s father had founded the Trinity College of Music; her mother, Madeline, was a much-published author. By 1905 Dorothy\u2019s pianist sister Ethel, her elder by 10 years, was teaching music in India. Dorothy herself performed at local events as a soprano and violinist. In 1909 Dorothy organised a WSPU meeting held on 1 June in the Parish Hall. This was addressed by \u2018polished platform speaker\u2019 Helen Ogston who had begun work a few months earlier as the first WSPU paid organiser in Brighton after achieving notoriety in December 1908 for wielding a dog whip against stewards who tried to eject her from the Albert Hall for interrupting a speech to Women Liberals by Lloyd George. A report in Votes for Women of the Burgess Hill meeting claimed that copies of this paper were sold out. Three months later the Mid Sussex Times reported that Helen Ogston, having \u2018made out so good a case for votes for women in such a brilliant speech\u2019, had been invited to return to Burgess Hill, and delivered \u2018another fine exposition of the subject\u2019. This second meeting was chaired by Revd Baldwin Pinney, senior curate at St John\u2019s. By August 1910, however, Dorothy had allied herself to the non-militants, and a Central Sussex Women\u2019s Suffrage Society garden party hosted by Mrs Carey of Lea Copse, Burgess Hill, concluded with a display of Morris dancing by schoolgirls under Dorothy\u2019s direction. In July 1913, when the Brighton Road contingent of the Great Suffrage Pilgrimage stopped for a meeting under the Reformers Tree in the centre of Burgess Hill, Mrs Bonavia Hunt was \u2019one of the numerous prominent Burgess Hillians present\u2019. Dorothy \u2018was among the cyclists who bore the suffragist colours\u2019 and was also named in the report of the Pilgrims setting off from Cuckfield the next morning. By September 1913 Dorothy had become secretary of a new Burgess Hill branch of the Central Sussex Women\u2019s Suffrage Society and had also joined the Mid Sussex branch of the Church League for Women\u2019s Suffrage. In February 1914, she and her father attended a large meeting in the St John\u2019s Institute addressed by \u2018one of the foremost women speakers in the country\u2019, Maude Royden, editor of Common Cause and a leading figure in the Church League for Women\u2019s Suffrage. The annual report delivered at the Central Sussex Women\u2019s Suffrage Society AGM in Cuckfield\u2019s Queen\u2019s Hall, in July 1914, where the guest speaker was Millicent Garrett Fawcett, made special mention of the first year\u2019s activity of the Burgess Hill branch \u2018under the able leadership of Miss Bonavia Hunt\u2019. Dorothy is known now as the author of Pemberley Shades, a sequel to Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice, first published in 1949 while she was living with one of her two brothers, a vicar in Bedfordshire.
