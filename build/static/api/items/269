She was profoundly deaf, had been married to Frank Harvey with 3 daughters, but was widowed at a young age. She was a physiotherapist and an early practitioner of physical therapy with the disabled children she cared for. In that time, this was extremely unusual: society was such that women were not encouraged to work in the medical profession and certainly not in roles that required physical contact. Kate had a long history of association with the suffrage movement. In 1882, a meeting of the Bromley, Beckenham and Shortlands Women\u2019s Suffrage Society was held at her house and she was secretary. The following year the Society held its first annual general meeting at her house. Kate was a leading member of the WFL from 1910, and in 1911 assisted leader Charlotte Despard with the King George V Women\u2019s Coronation Procession. Kate and Charlotte Despard became close friends: recorded in Charlotte\u2019s diary on 12 January 1912, is \u2018the anniversary of our love\u2019 which has caused much speculation as to the exact nature of Kate and Charlotte\u2019s relationship. In the 1911 census, the enumerator wrote \u2018House filled with suffragettes who refuse information.\u2019 Kate was also a member of the Women\u2019s Tax Resistance League (WTRL) and engaged in a 2-year battle with Kent County Council for refusing to pay a stamp to obtain a licence for her gardener. For 8-months\u2019 Kate barricaded herself in her house to avoid being arrested. The barricade was broken by bailiffs and she was arrested. In August 1913, Kate refused to pay and was sentenced to 2-months\u2019 in Holloway. Kate was the first person sentenced under the Insurance Act: protests were made about the inequality of Kate\u2019s treatment in comparison to the fines imposed on men for the same offence. Kate only served 1-month of her sentence due to concerns for her health.  She received a suffragist\u2019s prison medal for her courage.
