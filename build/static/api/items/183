She was a teacher and founded with her sisters a private school in Hill Street. She also sat on Coventry's Education Committee from 1903 to 1930 as well as working as an almoner for Spencer's Pensions - a pension charity for women. Mary joined the law abiding Coventry Women's Suffrage Society (affiliated to the NUWSS) and by 1914 had become its Vice president. Active in politics broadly, in 1917, she also became Honorary secretary of the newly founded Coventry branch of the National Union of Women Workers, and in 1920 was appointed a Justice of the Peace. Mary worked hard for local charities in Coventry mostly those related to girls welfare in the city and for educational charities like Soothern and Craner. She retired in 1930 and moved to Brighton with her sister Emma. Sadly, she died there the following year aged 73. Researcher: Tara Morton.
