In February 1909, she was arrested with seven others in a 'raid on the Commons', was charged with obstructing the police and declined to be bound over or pay sureties. She was sentenced to one month in Holloway prison but was released after two weeks. It is unclear whether this was because she went on hunger-strike. On her return to Cheltenham, the WFL branch presented her with a Holloway badge and two books. In 1912, she became Honorary Secretary of the branch. At the age of 22, Lilian Prust had married Sergei Alexandrovitch Borovikovsky. In the marriage register, he was described as a 'Noble Minister of Finance' at St. Petersburg and his father was a 'senator'. A son Sergei was born in 1904. Lilian's arrival in Cheltenham in March 1911 from a trip to Russia is recorded but she never seems to have lived there for any length of time and it is not known how she met her husband. As she does not appear on the census in 1911 and yet was in England, it is assumed that she evaded. She died in Gloucester Mental Hospital in 1926, by then a widow.
