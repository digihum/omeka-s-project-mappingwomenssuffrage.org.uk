One of the pioneer generation of impressive women doctors, she studied at the Royal Free in London, qualifying in 1901. A suffragette, she spoke at the great 1908 WSPU rally in Hyde Park ~ and soon impressed Emmeline Pankhurst. \r\n\r\n\u00a0Circa 1909 Dr Helena Jones was appointed the first schools\u2019 Medical Officer for the West Riding, and moved up to live in Halifax. Despite her demanding job, she became the WSPU organizer for Halifax, linking the Pankhursts\u2019 headquarters in London (undoubtedly by telephone) with local suffragettes - like Mary Taylor who lived just a short walk away.\r\n\r\nHelena Jones was the organizing genius behind Emmeline Pankhurst\u2019s census boycott meeting in Halifax on Thursday 30 March 1911. It was \u00a0held in the town-centre Mechanics\u2019 Institute Hall and Dr Jones took the chair at this crowded meeting. Three days later, on census night itself, Helena Jones was a very resolute evader: the enumerator wrote a statement to this effect on her schedule, which was signed by her domestic servant, the only occupant of the house.\r\n\r\nIn World War I, Dr Jones worked in Corsica with the Fabian Relief Fund. She then returned to Wales, working as assistant Medical Officer of Health in the Rhondda, in charge of the maternity and child welfare clinic. She died in September 1946.\r\n\r\nFor more see, Ryland Wallace, The Women\u2019s Suffrage Movement in Wales 1866-1928 (University of Wales Press, 2009).\r\n\r\n\r\n", "element_set": {"id": 3, "url": "/api/element_sets/3", "name": "Item Type Metadata", "resource": "element_sets"}, "element": {"id": 35, "url": "/api/elements/35", "name": "Biographical Text", "resource": "elements"}}], "extended_resources": []}
