Emmeline appeared as the NUWSS representative in a 1907 delegation to the local MP but became a member of the WFL when it was set up in the town. She appeared on its platform a number of times, most notably at a rowdy meeting in the Town Hall in 1908 when the national leaders, Charlotte Despard and Teresa Billington-Greig, were attacked by heckling opponents. In 1911, both she and her husband were probably living at 'Glenroy' - now in Sydenham Villa's Road - but evaded the census and were listed by name only by the enumerator at a Food Reform Guesthouse (see image) \r\n down the road where they seemed to have spent periods of time, together with its proprietor (see) Charlotte Bardsley (also a WFL activist).
