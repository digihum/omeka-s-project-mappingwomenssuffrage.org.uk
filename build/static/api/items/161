Lilla and her sister were active in founding the WFL's local branch in Ipswich and campaigned for the vote across the Ipswich area. The WFL were a suffragette organisation formed in 1907 as a break away group from the WSPU. Lilla was local organizer for the WFL newspaper, The Vote. The WFL were prepared to break the law, but believed in targeted, less violent action and civil disobedience, as well as maintaining close ties to the labour movement. The WFL was instrumental in organizing the suffrage boycott of the government census in 1911 and so, unsurprisingly, both Lilla and Constance took part by evading the census. The census official has written across the census form for 160 Norwich Road: 'There were two female suffragists in this family who went to some place unknown for the night. The female servant went with them'. The sisters (and presumably their servant) slept out with around 30 other local women at the Old Museum Rooms in Arcade Street (then a dance hall) - an evasion organised by Constance. Lilla's family home in Norwich Road continued as a hive of activity during the suffrage campaign - a regular venue for meetings and talks. By 1913, Lilla had taken over the role as Ipswich branch secretary from her sister Constance, likely because the latter was travelling the length and breadth of the country promoting the Votes for Women cause for the WFL.\r\n", "element_set": {"id": 3, "url": "/api/element_sets/3", "name": "Item Type Metadata", "resource": "element_sets"}, "element": {"id": 35, "url": "/api/elements/35", "name": "Biographical Text", "resource": "elements"}}, {"html": false, "text": "||||osm\r\nPOINT(126959.56163692831 6811908.737032267)", "element_set": {"id": 1, "url": "/api/element_sets/1", "name": "Dublin Core", "resource": "element_sets"}, "element": {"id": 38, "url": "/api/elements/38", "name": "Coverage", "resource": "elements"}}], "extended_resources": []}
