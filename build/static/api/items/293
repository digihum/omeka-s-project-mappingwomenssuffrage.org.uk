She married Will Dowson in 1894, first son of Benjamin and Alice Dowson and from 1906 lived in Felixstowe in the Park (previously they had lived at 10 Mapperley Road). The couple also had a bungalow on the Trent. Helena worked with her mother and sisters in law on various issues including women\u2019s suffrage. She took over the lead secretary role from her mother in 1895, affiliating to the National NUWSS and attending the executive meetings in London. She attended and organised demonstrations and meetings, held garden parties and stalls to fundraise, went on marches and events including some organised by the East Midlands Federation of NUWSS as well as some WSPU events. Helena also worked in Nottingham\u2019s suffrage shop in Regent\u2019s Chambers at 54 Long Row - now gone. In 1911, Helena was at home and complied with the April 2nd Census recording her occupation as secretary of the local women\u2019s suffrage society. In 1913, she and Maud - her sister-in-law - joined the Great Suffrage Pilgrimage held by the NUWSS as it passed through Nottingham, on route to London. Nellie picked up Millicent Fawcett and took her to speak at Chesterfield and Southwell; the only region in the shire where Mrs Fawcett spoke. They returned home after the East Midlands events and re-joined the final Hyde Park pilgrimage event on 26th July. Once the vote was won, Helena\u2019s work was commended with an illuminated address by fellow suffragists in Nottingham as follows: \u201cNOTTINGHAM SUFFRAGE LEADER HONOURED. To mark their appreciation of her services to the cause, the object of which has now been secured, friends of the women's suffrage movement in the city and county yesterday [18th July 1918] presented Mrs. W. E. Dowson, of Nottingham, with two large volumes of Japanese painters, with an illuminated address suitably inscribed, and a bronze statuette entitled \u201cSorrow.\" The ceremony took place at the residence of Mrs. W. R. Hamilton, Eastdene Alexandra Park, Nottingham, and was witnessed by a considerable gathering\u201d (Nottingham Evening Post, 19 July 1918). During WW1, Helena organised various fundraising and support for women; she was the Honorary Secretary of Queen\u2019s Work for Women; a member of the Anti-Profiteering committee; and set up two Baby Welcomes and a day nursery at the request of the Ministry of Health. She became the first woman JP in 1920 after the Sex Disqualification Removal Act and inaugurated the women\u2019s police court work \u2013 being Chair and secretary. Helena also stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate in 1919 and then became the first woman Liberal Councillor in 1920-24 representing the Meadows Ward. She campaigned to improve housing and sanitation and to extend the vote to women over 21 (on an equal footing to men) and for their access to representation on civic bodies. The NUWSS became the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC) in 1919 and in 1924 it became the Nottingham Women\u2019s Service Association later becoming the Townswomen\u2019s Guilds. Helena remained a member. She was also related by marriage to Eleanor Rathbone, who started the first Guilds. She maintained her house in The Park throughout her life, but from 1961 bought Northfield, a house in Newby Bridge, Ulverston now in Cumbria in the Lake District on the edge of Lake Windermere. It is here that she died at the age of 98. Her former home Felixstowe was demolished after her death in the 1960\u2019s. A plaque celebrating her role as the first Liberal woman Councillor was unveiled on 8 March 2020 on the Council House and on 20 July 2020 on the Justice Centre in commemoration of her as one of the first JP\u2019s. In 2021, a blue plaque will be mounted at the Justice Centre to celebrate all of Helena\u2019s incredible achievements.
