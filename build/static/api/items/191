She married Dr. William Fraser Annand and the couple had two children together. They likely moved to Coventry in 1909, whereupon Dr. Annand went into practice with Dr. Frederick Harman Brown - a partnership that lasted until the latter retired in 1919. Jessie soon joined the Coventry Women's Suffrage Society (the local branch of the law abiding NUWSS) along with the wife of her husband's business partner (see) Mrs. Dora Harman-Brown. Jessie was regular at suffrage meetings in the city and was active in a number of women's organisations over the years. She was Vice president of the Coventry Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) and a member of the local branch of the National Council for Women that sought to tackle gender inequality. She was also a keen worker at Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital. Jessie died at Clive house - the former home of friends the Harman-Brown's - in February 1939. A large memorial service was held for her at Coventry Cathedral and was very well attended. Researcher: Tara Morton.
