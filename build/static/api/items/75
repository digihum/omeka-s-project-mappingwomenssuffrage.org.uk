Margaret sat on the subcommittee of the Leamington Conservative and Unionist Women\u2019s Franchise Association (CUWFA). Later in 1912, she also appears as the Honorary Secretary of Leamington\u2019s Church League for Women\u2019s Suffrage (CLWS) so may have been a simultaneous member of both law-abiding groups. Along with other members of the CUWFA, she eschewed suffragette militancy in the local press.\r\n\r\nMargaret rather stands out as a teacher of Swedish Gymnastics in Leamington. This must have been a fairly popular pastime as press reports indicate Margaret was still actively teaching in 1919 (see Image below). Preliminary research via the local press indicates that by the 1920s, Margaret was at the forefront of local women\u2019s politics and likely remained so throughout her life. This included her role as honorary secretary of the local branch of the National Council of Women of Great Britain and Ireland, formed to \"promote sympathy of thought and purpose among the women of Great Britain and Ireland\" and had its roots in the National Union of Women Workers. Margaret's later political life is currently being investigated. Researcher: Tara Morton.
