The CUWFA formed in 1908 to work peacefully and constitutionally for \u2018the removal of the sex disqualification from the franchise\u2019 by bringing Conservative and Unionist\u2019s together.\r\n\r\nAda was very active for the CUWFA\u2019s Leamington branch, attending numerous suffrage society meetings and travelled down to London to participate in the Women\u2019s Coronation Procession in June 1911. The procession was organised by suffrage societies to rival the official Coronation procession of George V from which women were excluded. Approximately 40,000 women from around 30 women\u2019s suffrage societies participated, and the procession was seven miles long.\r\n\r\nDespite the CUWFA and its members commitment to peaceful methods of campaigning, many law-abiding women like Ada were losing patience with the Liberal government and becoming more sympathetic to the often illegal and sometimes violent tactics used by the suffragettes. Ada's feelings are captured on her 1911 census return when she writes \u2018non-militant suffragist (at present)\u2019 under her name. This tells us that Ada was at a crossroads between the non-militant and militant paths in 1911. What did she decide? We can\u2019t say for certain, but there is no evidence yet to suggest she engaged in illegal activity thereafter, or that she joined a more militant society like the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (WSPU) which had a branch in Leamington at that time. Ada also wrote \u2018Votes for women\u2019 in every margin of her census return in protest at the government's refusal to allow her a voice through the vote, thus denying her rights as a citizen. After its  collection, and unbeknown to her, someone, probably the census agent, wrote \u2018No\u2019 in front of each 'Votes for Women' declaration in the margins, thus mounting his own counter protest.
