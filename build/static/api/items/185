She served for many years as Headmistress at Coventry High School for girls, opened by her at the Quadrant. A College House was later added in Holyhead Road. Agnes' school was well provisioned - with a hockey and cricket field, tennis and swimming pool - it also took boarders and prepared pupils for all public examinations. During her time at the school, Agnes became a member of the Coventry Women's Suffrage Society (a local branch of the law abiding NUWSS) and in 1910 held a Votes for Women meeting at the Quadrant. Agnes eventually retired from the school due to failing eyesight, and in her leisure time enjoyed her involvement with the Coventry National History and Scientific Society as well as with the Coventry City Guild. She died on April 27th, 1929 aged 71 and her funeral service was held in Coventry Cathedral where she was a regular worshipper. In her will, Agnes left a stipend to her Assistant Headmistress at the school, Miss Mary Kemp, with the remainder of her estate being equally divided between her sister, brother and her friend and companion, Miss Margaret Elkins, 'as a reward for her unfailing and disinterested devotion to me'.
