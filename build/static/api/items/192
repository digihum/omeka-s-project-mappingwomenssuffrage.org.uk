J & J Cash Ltd, founded by his late father Joseph Cash. The couple had two sons one of whom was killed in the First World War. Elsie was a regular campaigner for female suffrage and was a member of the Coventry Women's Suffrage Society, the local branch of the large, law abiding NUWSS. She was likely also a member of the CUWFA (Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association). Elsie was also active in the wider Coventry community fundraising for local charities, campaigning for the extension of University examinations to girls, sitting on the Council's National Insurance Committee and its Education Committee until her resignation in 1915. She later moved to Keresley House and then to Walcote, Blackdown, where she was active in the church and wider community. Elsie died there in 1953 aged 84 and her funeral was held at Lillington Church. Researcher: Tara Morton.
