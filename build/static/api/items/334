Rose lived first in Ditchling with her companion Susan Armitage and Susan\u2019s orphaned niece and nephew. By 1911 Rose was a popular speaker for the Central Sussex Women\u2019s Suffrage Society (CSWSS): a speech at a summer garden meeting was reportedly \u2018as refreshing as fizzing magnesia\u2019. With Brighton\u2019s Edith Pickworth and (see) Flora de Gaudrion Merrifield, Rose addressed outreach meetings in Ditchling and the village of Streat. In 1912 she and Susan moved their household to Cuckfield to live near CSWSS secretary and treasurer, (see) Edith Bevan, and helped Edith Bevan organise the Haywards Heath Sweated Industries Exhibition. Rose was on the platform at its opening, with Flora, Marie Corbett, and Louisa Martindale. As a member of the Girls Friendly Society, she worked with Dorothy Bonavia Hunt and her mother, and Mrs Bonavia Hunt expressed appreciation of the \u2018spiritual aspect\u2019 of Rose\u2019s suffragist principles. Rose was the leading light of the Sussex Suffrage Amateurs, who performed plays written for the Actresses\u2019 Franchise League. A favourite was A Chat with Mrs Chicky. Rose always played the title role; those who took a turn to play opposite her included (see) Alys Russell. Rose enjoyed the support of her brother, Lt-Col Chute Ellis. Declaring himself to have been a suffragist for 30 years, he chaired a meeting, held by the Burgess Hill Pleasant Wednesday Evening Society, addressed by Rose on Woman\u2019s Place and Power in the State. When he and his wife hosted a suffrage garden meeting at their Burgess Hill home in Burgess Hill, he introduced speaker Rose as \u2018well-known in the neighbourhood\u2019. On Monday 21 July, Rose was among Cuckfield and Central Sussex suffragists, led by Edith Bevan and accompanied by photographer (see) Douglas Miller, who met suffrage Pilgrims from Brighton at Stonepound Crossroads, Hassocks. The following morning, she and Susan joined Edith Bevan, (see) Marie Corbett, (see) Louisa Martindale, Flora de Gaudrion Merrifield, (see) Dorothy Bonavia Hunt, and other CSWSS members, to set off from Cuckfield for the second day of marching. At the Hyde Park rally at the end of that week, Rose, Susan, and Edith were among the CSWSS stalwarts present around the Reformers\u2019 Tree. A month later, at a CSWSS meeting at Ditchling, Rose referred to the Pilgrimage as \u2018the most delightful week of my whole life\u2019, a vindication of NUWSS non-militant methods. During the War, Rose\u2019s campaigned for NUWSS hospital tents and children\u2019s welfare; she helped organise a Ministry of Food talk in Cuckfield by (see) Elizabeth Robins. After the War, she and Susan moved with Edith Bevan to East Chiltington, Plumpton. Here Rose became successively founder, secretary, and President of the Plumpton WI, and ten years later, founder member of the League of Nations Plumpton branch.
