On the 1911 census, by the names of two of Lydia\u2019s servants was written \u2019suffragist\u2019 (see Sarah Reynolds and Caroline Marchant). No further information is known at this stage about any involvement they may have had in the suffrage movement. Lydia\u2019s family began by supporting the WSPU.  In 1908 her daughters Dorothy and (see) May, with friend Gladys Sherris (Henfield) were driven by Lydia\u2019s elder son from Tunbridge Wells to London to participate in the WSPU 21st of June procession. Their motor car was described as being \u2018brilliantly decorated for the occasion, with rosettes in green, white and purple\u2019 and with a small \u201cVotes for Women\u201d placard fixed in front of the car and a large notice advertising the demonstration hanging out at the back. Later that year, however, Dorothy was to found the Tunbridge Wells branch of the WFL. Another of Lydia\u2019s daughters, Kate, was arrested after taking part in a WSPU demonstration in November 1910. Lydia participated in the NUWSS pilgrimage from Kent to London in 1913 entertaining 30 to 40 guests at her house. In the same year, a Miss Le Lacheur attended a meeting about the Tunbridge Wells Nevill Cricket Ground which had been destroyed by suffragettes in an arson attack. This was probably Dorothy who with two other women interrupted the meeting and kept interjecting questions to those speaking against women\u2019s suffrage.
