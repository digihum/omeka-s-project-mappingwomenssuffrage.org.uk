She appeared on the platforms of the local WSPU, to which she contributed money in its early years, and the WFL and was not opposed to law-breaking. This is evidenced by her census evasion in 1911 in protest at women not having the parliamentary vote. She was a respected speaker and campaigner, prepared to speak in outdoor venues and outlying villages as well as in the Town Hall for example. In 1913, she was assaulted while speaking to a crowd gathered for the arrival of the Pilgrimage in Cheltenham but, undeterred, she continued the next day to Cirencester where there was a similar attack and she had to take refuge in a nearby village. Before her marriage to Major General John Swiney, she was an aspiring painter. Four of her six children were born in India where she had also been born but the family settled in Cheltenham in the late 1870s. She was a supporter of the Eugenics Society, the Ethical movement and the Theosophical Society and was Vice-Chairman of the local Food and Health Reform Society.
