In 1901 Evelyne was a domestic nurse in the household of Rev. Frederick Lewis Donaldson, his wife Sarah and their five children in St. Mark\u2019s, Leicester. While in Leicester, Evelyne joined the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union. She spoke in support of Mrs Pankhurst at a meeting in September 1907. In February 1908 at Welford Coffee House, Leicester, Evelyne moved a resolution calling for the release of members of the Women\u2019s Freedom League sentenced to imprisonment. According to \u2018Votes for Women\u2019, she contributed 2s 6d to the \u00a320,000 fund in April 1908. By 1911 Evelyne was living at 48, Rutland Gardens, Hove with her mother Prudence, aunt Naomi and sisters, Kate and Ethel. On the census form, Evelyne describes herself as a domestic nurse, author and suffrage worker. In the column headed \u2018Infirmity\u2019 the word \u2018Disenfranchised\u2019 was written making Evelyne along with her sister Ethel census resisters. Her older sister Katherine Close evaded the 1911 census for 48 Rutland Gardens, Hove as did her married sister (see) Elizabeth Close Shipham in Lewisham. Evelyne Close\u2019s first novel \u2018The Harvest\u2019 was published in 1911 and was advertised in \u2018The Vote\u2019. In October 1911 she gave a speech to Greenwich Church League for Women\u2019s Suffrage (CLWS) where her sister, Elizabeth was Branch secretary. At the AGM in February 1912, the Brighton and Hove CLWS elected Katherine Close Branch Secretary so sisters Evelyne and Ethel also joined the committee. Meetings were held at 48 Rutland Gardens, Hove until an office was rented in Brighton in 1913. The CLWS General Council meeting was held in July 1913 in Brighton and Hove and organised by Katherine Close and the rest of the committee. Evelyne\u2019s employer in 1901, Rev Frederick Lewis Donaldson, attended the meeting. Evelyne gave a lecture on infant mortality in January 1914 to the CLWS. She published \u2018The Roll of Honour\u2019 in 1915, one of the earliest novels to reflect the war and it received good reviews. Evelyne went on to publish several more novels throughout her career. She died in Hove in 1935.
