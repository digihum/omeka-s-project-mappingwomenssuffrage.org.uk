Her father had been a factory hand who turned to the Church Missionary Society to improve himself. He spent six years on missionary work in Yoruba, before marrying a teacher, Annie Craig. Esther was the couple\u2019s first child and was looked after by grandparents or sent to the Church Missionary Society\u2019s (CMS) Boarding school in Highbury, London, while her parents continued their work in Africa. When Edward Roper returned to England in 1874, he spent three years preaching around Lancashire. Esther went with him on many of these journeys. Aged only 6, she had an early introduction to the harsh conditions experienced in the textile industries. Annie valued education and Esther was sent to school rather than out to work. With support from the CMS, Esther was enrolled as one of the first women students at Owens College (see image), Manchester, graduating with a degree in 1891. Whilst at Owens, Esther became involved in the Debating Society, and in settlement work. This convinced her to work for women\u2019s suffrage, and the cause of women\u2019s rights \u2013 particularly fair and equal pay for working class women. In 1893, Esther took over and re-invigorated the North of England Society for Women\u2019s Suffrage. She traveled extensively around Lancashire collecting signatures for Millicent Fawcett\u2019s special appeal and became an executive member for the NUWSS in London. In 1896, Esther\u2019s life completely changed, when she met the radical Irish writer (see) Eva Gore-Booth. Both were recuperating in Italy and whilst it is in not clear whether the two women became lovers, certainly they fell in love, and remained so for the rest of their lives. Eva moved to Manchester to be with Esther, and the two women then lived together until Eva\u2019s death in 1926. Esther\u2019s work for women\u2019s right was prodigious. Although not a natural orator, she spoke at meetings all over the country, arguing that the vote would empower women to achieve equality in the working world \u2013 in training, opportunity, and most importantly, wages. She criticised protective legislation which limited women\u2019s opportunities and often their wages. In line with this, she campaigned hard against legal restrictions on the work of Pit Brow Lasses in Lancashire and of Barmaids and pub Landladies across the country. In 1911, Esther and Eva were living in Victoria Park in Manchester. The census record describes Esther as \u2018the occupier\u2019 (see Eva Gore Booth's entry for census form). However, neither woman was in the property on census night, nor are they recorded elsewhere. It is highly possible that they took part in the mass evasion \u2018sleepover\u2019 at Denison House\u2013 (see Jessie Stephenson WSPU member). Jill Liddington, in Vanishing for the Vote (2014) describes them as \u2018probably present\u2019 (p.178). In 1913, the couple moved to London for Eva\u2019s health. During the war both women supported conscientious objectors, welfare work, and the peace campaign. After Eva\u2019s early death, Esther devoted herself to organising the publication of her poetry and other writing, maintaining herself with some history teaching. Esther died in April 1938 and the two are buried together in Hampstead.
