A champion of ethical socialism, she left the comfort of Raunds as a young woman to work in the slums of St. Pancras as a Sister of the People to improve the lives of working women and their families. She later transferred to the Bermondsey Settlement where she ran several Working Girls Clubs and other community initiatives for the poor. It was there that she met her husband Alfred a medical doctor and the two married in 1900.\r\n\r\nAda aligned herself with the radical wing of the Liberal Party, but she left in 1906 when it failed to honour its promises on votes for women, joining the Independent Labour Party (ILP) instead. She became deeply involved in the work of the ILP, a party that organised emancipation in the factories and on the streets. She was enthused by the \u2018real business\u2019 of \u2018practical socialism\u2019 and in that same year helped found and lead the Women\u2019s Labour League. When it formed a year later in 1907, Ada supported the Women\u2019s Freedom League (WFL) a Votes for women society led by her friend and fellow poverty campaigner Charlotte Despard. Ada eschewed the more violent tactics of Mrs Pankhurst\u2019s WSPU.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, Ada became the first woman Councillor in London, and with husband Alfred, she helped lead the \u2018Bermondsey Uprising\u2019 in 1911 when the working population of Bermondsey went on strike for better working conditions. Ada\u2019s recruitment of 14,000 local women into the National Federation of Women Workers led by Mary Macarthur was instrumental. Ada did not take part in the suffrage boycott of the census that was also organised in 1911 to protest at women not having the vote and endorsed by the WFL. The reasons are unclear why she complied, but many women like Ada who campaigned for better living conditions in poor areas believed women should fill in the census because its details helped reveal the true state of overcrowding and infant deaths for example. The couples census form also reveals the tragic loss of their own daughter Joyce to scarlet fever. Interestingly, Ada's husband Alfred lists Ada on the census as simply a \u2018housewife\u2019 - yet she was so much more.\r\n\r\nAda also became the first woman Mayor in London in 1922. As Mayor of Bermondsey, she steadfastly refused to wear the mayoral regalia, nor acknowledge Royal ceremonial occasions. Neither would she fly the Union Jack on Bermondsey Town Hall; instead, she chose to fly the red flag of socialism, emblazoned with the Bermondsey heraldic symbol. Ada believed strongly and campaigned throughout her life for the development of co-operatives, green spaces, universal suffrage, free school meals, free national health service, slum-clearance and humane working conditions. During her time in office, she planted thousands of trees in Bermondsey to improve the air quality, developed green spaces, planted municipal flower beds, had well-designed social housing built, communal laundries, clinics, swimming pools and a solarium.\r\n\r\nAs pacifists, she and Alfred turned to Quakerism and both passionately spoke out against WW1 and then WW2, which they saw as an inevitable consequence of the injustices of the Versailles Treaty towards Germany. Ada is only the 15th woman in London to be accorded a statue. Her figure (as part of Dr Salter\u2019s Daydream group sculpture, situated by the Thames in Bermondsey) marks her work as a woman trade unionist, a woman environmentalist, a Quaker, and a woman politician.\r\n\r\nContributed by: Lynn Morris, playwright and performer inspired by Ada's story (www.journeymentheatre.com)   \r\n\r\nSources and further reading:\r\n\r\nAda Salter: Pioneer of Ethical Socialism by Graham Taylor (Lawrence and Wishart 2016)\r\n\r\nUnder Salter Lectures, there is a full transcript of Lynn Morris\u2019s one woman play about the life of Ada Salter called \u2018Red Flag Over Bermondsey\u2019 at https://quakersocialists.org.uk/\r\n", "element_set": {"id": 3, "url": "/api/element_sets/3", "name": "Item Type Metadata", "resource": "element_sets"}, "element": {"id": 35, "url": "/api/elements/35", "name": "Biographical Text", "resource": "elements"}}, {"html": false, "text": "||||osm\r\nPOINT(-7163.520551040778 6709422.736140364)", "element_set": {"id": 1, "url": "/api/element_sets/1", "name": "Dublin Core", "resource": "element_sets"}, "element": {"id": 38, "url": "/api/elements/38", "name": "Coverage", "resource": "elements"}}], "extended_resources": []}
