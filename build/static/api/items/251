After 1901 she lived in Worthing and Hove. Kate was a governess and a born organiser. She was secretary of the Worthing branch of the Children\u2019s Union of the Church of England Waifs\u2019 and Strays\u2019 Society in June 1907, increasing membership from six to sixty children in a few months. In 1911, Kate was living in Hove, Sussex with her mother, aunt and sisters Evelyne and Ethel at 48 Rutland Gardens, Hove. Her married sister (see) Elizabeth Close Shipham, living in Lewisham, often visited. Her brother, Richard Bevill Middleton Close was a clergyman in Middlesborough. Kate\u2019s involvement in the Church League for Women\u2019s Suffrage (CLWS) seems to have started through her sister, Elizabeth who was on the Executive Committee. Kate Close spoke on prison reform to the Brighton and Hove CLWS in October 1911. In \u2018Votes for Women\u2019 in November 1911, Kate offered to copy extracts from articles in Braille. Kate evaded the government's 1911 census staying away from her home at 48 Rutland Gardens - as did her sister Elizabeth in Lewisham. Their mother, Prudence had two of Elizabeth\u2019s children staying with her there, and their sisters Evelyne and Ethel, aunt Naomi and the Swiss-born servant, Jeanne were all recorded as suffrage workers there. At the AGM in February 1912, the Brighton and Hove CLWS elected Kate Close as Branch Secretary. Meetings were held at 48 Rutland Gardens, Hove until an office was rented in Brighton in 1913. Kate arranged bicycle rides to surrounding villages to hold open air meetings twice weekly in the summer of 1912. The CLWS General Council meeting in July 1913 was held in Brighton and Hove, organised by Kate and the committee. The programme involved a public reception, church services and General Council meeting. Kate wrote: \u2018The Reception was a financial success but the success was also there of added spiritual zeal and increased enthusiasm for the Cause\u2019. Her organisational skills were praised by Rev. Claude Hinscliff in his meeting report. Kate remained Branch Secretary until the closure of the office in 1919. She became secretary of the Brighton branch of the Women\u2019s Freedom League in 1923. Kate Close died in 1926. Her obituary described her as a skillful artist, expert teacher, untiring cyclist, excellent swimmer and loyal colleague. It went on to give more insights into her \u2018unique personality\u2019 in glowing terms (see image).
