She subsequently became a fully-fledged WSPU suffragette and was arrested five times during the women\u2019s suffrage campaign for militant activity \u2013 twice in 1909, twice in 1910 and once more in 1912 (see image). In 1909, Ellen went on hunger strike during a term of imprisonment and was awarded the WSPU\u2019s Hunger Strike Medal. When she was arrested in November 1910, it was at an infamous protest that became known as \u2018Black Friday\u2019 because of the violence meted out upon suffragettes by the police. Ellen was injured in the scuffles that broke out. In 1911, when the census survey was taken, Ellen was working and residing at the New Hospital for Women, Euston Road, London. The hospital was originally founded by Britain\u2019s first female doctor, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, and occupied several premises before finding a home in Euston Road (see images). Ellen appears on the census survey taken there but resists, refusing to give her information. The census official writes: \u2019Suffragette \u2013 Refused Information\u2019. Subsequently, Ellen discovered she had cancer and would not recover. Her commitment to the suffragette cause is really captured by what she did next despite her diagnosis. A demonstration was organised by the WSPU on the 4th March 1912 in support of which Ellen wrote to WSPU leader Emmeline Pankhurst declaring herself 'A Soldier to the death'. She then set fire to a basket of wood shavings at the General Post Office, also breaking a window there, and gave herself up to police to raise publicity for the cause. That month, she was sentenced to six months imprisonment and was carried from court to the prison hospital. Prison authorities aware of her condition, asked Ellen to swear an undertaking against further militant action in consideration of her early release. She refused but expressed that \u2018it was not in her to offend again\u2019. A petition ensued for Ellen's release which likely happened in May. She was cared for upon her release by (see) WSPU Nurse Catherine Pine and Gertrude Townend at their nursing home at 9 Pembridge Gardens, Notting Hill. She died a few months later in August, 1912.
