The couple\u2019s own home was Knightscroft, Rustington, near Littlehampton, close to the home of Agnes and Rhoda Garrett, sister, and cousin respectively of Millicent Garrett Fawcett. In December 1909, Maud chaired a Gloucester Women\u2019s Suffrage Society meeting; speakers included her husband, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and Alys Russell. In 1910 she became President of the new Littlehampton Women\u2019s Suffrage Society, and, in 1911, of the Brighton and Hove Women\u2019s Franchise Society (BHWFS). In 1911, Maud chaired two meetings in support of the Conciliation Bill then before Parliament: in May at St James Hall, Worthing, where speakers included Lady Betty Balfour, Marie Corbett, and Israel Zangwill, and in September at Rustington House. In February 1912, the Parrys were \u2018among the distinguished men and women\u2019 on the platform at the Albert Hall mass meeting addressed by Millicent Garrett Fawcett and Lloyd George. Tiny by comparison but described as \u2018breaking new ground\u2019 was the meeting Maud chaired at Arundel in June, addressed by Alys Russell, Sir Harry Johnston of nearby Poling, and Cicely Corbett. Maud was on the platform at a BHWFS demonstration in November 1912 attended by representatives of the 49 branches of the Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire Federation, and from the National Union of Women Workers, the Trades Council, the Women\u2019s Local Government Association, the Independent Labour Party, and the British Women\u2019s Temperance Association. In 1912, she was among over 400 signatories of a letter to the Press, MPs, and the committee representing the West End businesses vandalised by militant suffragettes, deploring such lawless action, but urging the committee to pursue the redressing of the militants\u2019 grievances rather than demand punitive legislation. Meanwhile, her husband joined GB Shaw, George Lansbury, Lord Lytton, Granville-Barker, Sir Arthur Pinero, Israel Zangwill, and other well-known men, in contributing to the Pall Mall Magazine their arguments in favour of women\u2019s suffrage. On 19 July 1913 Maud led the Littlehampton contingent of Suffrage Pilgrims from Littlehampton Station to Rustington. Here they were joined by Sir Hubert Parry, before \u2018entraining\u2019 to Brighton where the Parrys were to head the procession of over 100 Pilgrims northwards on the Monday morning. In October 1913 Maud, Alys Russell and Florence de Fonblanque, participated in meetings held during a Suffrage march from Cosham to a Church Congress in Southampton. In November, these three women spoke at a meeting in Littlehampton chaired by Sir Harry Johnston. In February 1914 Maud was on the platform at a Lewes Women\u2019s Suffrage Society meeting; in April she spoke at a BHWFS meeting; and in June she chaired a suffrage meeting hosted by Miss Holland at 1a Holland Walk, South Kensington. At the outbreak of War, the Parrys, helped by Alys Russell, held a meeting at Knightscroft to discuss how women could help the war effort. Towards the end of the War, Sir Hubert Parry\u2019s setting of William Blake\u2019s Jerusalem was to become the celebratory \u2018voters\u2019 hymn\u2019.
