He obtained a BA in Classics in 1892 from Trinity College, Cambridge and became a schoolmaster and Schools\u2019 Inspector. He also wrote Latin textbooks and translations. He married (see) Elizabeth Mary Margaret Close in 1897. They lived with their three children in Blackheath and Lewisham. Frank Shipham spoke on 2 September 1909 at a new Union for Men and Women to obtain Women's Suffrage in Hyde Park to over 1000 persons. He spoke on 5 Sep at Clapham Common and on 9 Sep at the Men's League for Womens' Suffrage, Open Air Campaign, Hyde Park. It was reported: 'Messers B Shipham & W Stephens both made excellent speeches and never lost the sympathetic interest of the audience'. He was at the inaugural meeting of the Church League for Women\u2019s Suffrage (CLWS) on 11 Jan 1910 and seconded the following resolution proposed by Dr. Jane Walker: \u2018\u2019In the opinion of this meeting it is to the highest interests of Church and nation that the franchise be extended to women; and that a \u2018Church League\u2019, independent of party, be formed in the Name of God to secure for women the Parliamentary vote as it is or may be granted to men; to use the power thus obtained to establish equality of rights and opportunities between the sexes, and to promote the social and industrial well-being of the community.\u2019\u2019 The resolution was passed unanimously. The Lewisham branch of the CLWS was newly formed at the end of 1910 and Frank and his wife Elizabeth  were heavily involved. On 18 November Elizabeth proposed a resolution supporting the \u2018\u2019Votes for Women\u2019\u2019 Bill urging that it should become law before the end of the present year. Frank seconded the resolution saying it was the duty of the Church to take the matter in hand. The resolution was carried with unanimity. Frank Shipham was at home in Lewisham with his daughter, Monica, for the government census survey in April 1911. He showed his support for the cause by declaring himself \u2018Husband of the occupier\u2019 instead of \u2018Head of the household'. Elizabeth evaded the census. Continuing with the campaign in June 1911 Frank Close Shipham, Esq. MA, FCP spoke at a garden party in Blackheath. On 1 Jun 1918 he became President of CLWS.
