She was an assistant school mistress in 1911 when the family were living at 10 Clifton Street, Wolverhampton. We know little else about Lucy at this time except that she belonged to the Wolverhampton branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. She was listed as Superintendent of the Entertainment Department, 1912-1914, and the \u201cMisses Dilger\u201d were actively involved collecting subscriptions and delivering notices in the district of Tettenhall Road. The Society\u2019s annual report 1913 \u2013 1914 also includes an account of a play produced by a Miss Dilger, entitled \u201cThe Better Half\u201d, in January 1914, and that \u201cThe majority of the characters were excellently portrayed, and all who attended will, we feel sure, be glad to learn they helped to add a very substantial sum to our exchequer.\u201d Lucy never married, and died in Hove, Sussex, in 1946.
