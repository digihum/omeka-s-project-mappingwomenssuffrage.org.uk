The family lived in Hammersmith, Eastbourne, Worthing and Hove. With her three sisters, Ethel was involved in good causes and helped organise a fair and sale of work in Worthing in 1907 in aid of the Children\u2019s Union of the Church of England Waifs\u2019 and Strays\u2019 Society. In 1911 Ethel was living at 48, Rutland Gardens, Hove with her mother Prudence, aunt Naomi and sisters, Katherine and Evelyne. Her two nephews, children of her married sister, (see) Elizabeth Close Shipham, were also staying the night of the government's 1911 census survey. On the census form, Ethel describes herself as a domestic nurse and suffrage worker. In the column headed \u2018Infirmity\u2019 the word \u2018Disenfranchised\u2019 was written qualifying Ethel as a resister. Her older sisters, Katherine Close who lived at 48 Rutland Gardens, and Elizabeth Close Shipham who lived in Lewisham, both evaded the 1911 census. Meetings of the Brighton and Hove branch of the Church League for Women\u2019s Suffrage (CLWS) were held at 48 Rutland Gardens, Hove until an office was rented in Brighton in 1913. At the AGM in February 1912, the Brighton and Hove CLWS branch elected Katherine Close as Branch Secretary with sisters Ethel and Evelyne also on the committee. Ethel and Katherine remained on the committee in 1913. A interesting lecture held in April 1913 was curiously entitled \u2018Dangers in Pleasure Resorts for Resident Girls\u2019. The CLWS General Council meeting was held in July 1913, hosted by the Brighton and Hove Branch. The programme involved a public reception, church services and the General Council meeting and the organisation of the event was praised by Rev. Claude Hinscliff. The CLWS office was sub-let to the Royal Marines in 1915 as part of the war effort. Ethel lived at the same address until her death in 1957.
