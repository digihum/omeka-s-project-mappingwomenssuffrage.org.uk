Sophia was born a princess, but her father\u2019s abandonment of his family meant that she was no stranger to suffering as a child. Her father left his family destitute and Sophia\u2019s mother died soon after from alcoholism and depression. Sophia was a committed member of the WSPU, taking part in one of the deputations to Parliament on \u2018Black Friday\u2019 (18 November 1910) that resulted in violent scenes in Parliament Square. At another time, she threw herself onto the Prime Minister\u2019s car pressing a \u2018Votes for Women\u2019 pamphlet against the windshield. She was arrested during the suffrage campaign, but was never sent to prison perhaps because of her high social status. She was a regular speaker at meetings of the Richmond branch of the WSPU and, as a member of the Women\u2019s Tax Resistance League too, on several occasions had goods seized after she had refused to pay taxes (see images).\u00a0In 1911, Sophia took part in the suffragette boycott of the government census survey writing 'No Vote No Census' across her census return. She also took to selling the Suffragette newspaper outside Hampton Court Palace where she lived, standing next to an advertising board (see image). This prompted calls for her removal from her \u2018grace and favour\u2019 home at the palace to try and stop such antics (see images, letter to Lord Crewe attached).
