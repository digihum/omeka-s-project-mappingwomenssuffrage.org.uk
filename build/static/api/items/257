Alice a Liberal, was active in various social and political matters. She spent four hours in the market place listening to debates re the election in 1866; was active in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Act; in March 1869 in campaigning to protect women\u2019s property rights and sat on a committee working to allow women to be appointed as Poor Law Guardians. In the 1870s and 1880s, Alice attended various women\u2019s suffrage meetings and became secretary of the Nottingham Women\u2019s Suffrage Society in 1894 though she handed over to her daughter in law Nellie in 1896 due to ill health. In 1906, Alice and Ben moved to Sulney Fields, Upper Boughton near Melton Mowbray (map position approximate) where they were still resident in 1911 as was daughter and suffragist (see) Maud Dowson. Later, the extended family rented a property in Salcombe in Devon which they later brought, and it remained in the family for over 100 years. We know a lot about her activities as her granddaughter published Alice\u2019s diaries \u2018What Grandmother said\u2019.
