Louisa Martindale was well-known as a women\u2019s suffrage campaigner when she moved to Cheeleys, Horsted Keynes in 1903. During the 1890s, as President of the Brighton Women Liberals Association (WLA), and Vice-President of the Burgess Hill WLA, she called for equal voting rights with men and joined the executive committee of the newly-formed Practical Suffragists within the Women Liberals Federation. In 1904, with (see) Marie, Margery and Cicely Corbett, she attended the International Congress of Women in Berlin at which the International Women\u2019s Suffrage Alliance was founded. The portrait of Louisa by the German artist Clara Ewald shows her sitting behind a desk on which rests a volume inscribed \u2018International Frauen Congress 1904\u2018. Meetings held by the Liberals in Horsted Keynes included a \u2018Call to Women\u2019 in 1906 at which Louisa and the Corbetts urged women to take part in local government. In 1907, Louisa invited the Brighton and Hove branch of the WSPU and local WLA members to a garden party at Cheeleys at which the speakers were Emmeline Pankhurst and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. In June 1910, referring to over 40 years\u2019 campaigning on her own part, she acknowledged that the WSPU\u2019s \u2018militant ways\u2019 had \u2018worked wonders and roused our sex as we could not\u2019. Soon afterwards, however, she hosted the inaugural meeting of the Horsted Keynes branch of the constitutional Cuckfield and Central Sussex Women\u2019s Suffrage Society in the Congregational Hall. This had been built thanks to her efforts and she had appointed as its first pastor Hatty Baker, founder of the Free Church League for Women\u2019s Suffrage. Subsequent suffragist meetings in the Congregational Hall, included two talks in February 1911 by Lady Stout, whose husband had been Premier of New Zealand: on the advantages of women having the vote there, and on \u2018Temperance Reform and Social Progress\u2019, a subject of particular interest to Louisa. The following month Louisa was on the platform at a Cuckfield and Central Sussex Women\u2019s Suffrage Society meeting in the Congregational Hall to support \u2018distinguished non-militant suffragists,\u2019 Lady Sybil Brassey and Lady Betty Balfour. In 1910 the Brighton and Hove Women\u2019s Franchise Society acted upon Louisa\u2019s proposal that a Women\u2019s Local Government Association be formed to encourage women to stand for election. Louisa\u2019s elder daughter, Dr Louisa Martindale, was a committee member of this branch of the NUWSS, and a pioneering specialist in women\u2019s health. Mother and daughter were centrally involved in the establishment of Brighton\u2019s Lady Chichester Hospital for Women and Girls, run entirely by women. Louisa\u2019s younger daughter, Hilda, at this time a factory inspector, was also to spend her career working for women\u2019s rights. The Congregational Hall is now known as the Martindale Centre; a memorial plaque there describes Louisa as \u2018a champion of a larger life for women\u2019.
