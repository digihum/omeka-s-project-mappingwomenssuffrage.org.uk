Charlotte along with her mother in law Annette, was a member of the Coventry Women's Suffrage Society (CWSS) a local branch of the NUWSS. She was ever present at local suffrage meetings and with her husband Edward, was also active for the Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital (Edward was Chairman of the hospital board) and with the local branch of the NSPCC. During the First World War, Charlotte helped with the Serbian Refugee Fund while Edward worked for the Ministry of Munitions. He later became Conservative MP for Tamworth and Warwickshire and spoke in that role in the 1920s in support of extending votes or women to the same terms as men (finally achieved in 1928). He went on to become President of the British Chamber of Commerce; was knighted in 1922; and made a Lord in 1929. That year he resigned his seat as Conservative MP stating that his action was taken 'from a sense of public duty'. During those years, the couple lived at Allesley Hall, near Coventry, and remained active charity workers. They later moved to Berkshire in retirement. Charlotte (then Dowager Lady Iliffe) was widowed in 1960 and died at home at Yattendon Court, Berkshire in 1987 aged 95. The couple had a son and a daughter the former being made an Alderman of Coventry in 1969. Researcher: Tara Morton.
