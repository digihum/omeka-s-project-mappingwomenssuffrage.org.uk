Born in 1879 to the headmaster of Westwood Heath school in Warwickshire, her position as the only girl in a family of boys \u2013 \u201can unpaid skivvy\u201d \u2013 made her only too aware of women\u2019s position in society as a whole. By the age of 26 she was schoolmistress in a girls\u2019 school in Birmingham. Cicely supplemented her income by teaching needlework to women at evening classes. It was here, in a class entitled \u201cHow to make a shirt for my husband\u201d, that she first heard talk of the suffrage movement. In 1905, she joined the WSPU, attending and speaking at events held in Birmingham and London. In later life, she reflected: \u2018If a crowd assembled   accident, political, noted personage, royalty, roughs, etc., etc., I joined it and worked through to the opposite end and I knew my subject well.  I possessed the schoolmistress' voice   a carrying, rather than a shouting one, and a dominating tone, and was accustomed to being stared at, etc., etc.  I could mount and descend from goods' wagons and my small height would save many a staggering blow. These were some activities I could do and did\u2019. She was aware that she needed to protect her work in education, writing: \u2018I was a state schoolmistress so no limelight and no absence from work!  No press reports!  No medical support reports for injuries inflicted or strained nerves!\u201d. However, she collected the stones that were thrown at her, calling them her \u201cjewels\u201d. Some of these, along with her WSPU sash and satchel are now in the collection of the Warwick Museum. In 1911, she was living with her father in the house she had bought in Stechford, Birmingham. She appears to have evaded the 1911 census, as \u201cDaughter is a suffragette\u201d is written across the form after her father\u2019s entry. Whether Cicely or her father wrote this gesture of defiance is unclear, but it is possible that he shared his daughter\u2019s values. It is interesting to note that the census return for next-door\u2019s house, later occupied by Cicely and her husband, is simply a blank form with one word written on it: \u201cSuffragettes\u201d \u2013 perhaps pointing to a group evasion? Cicely married Ernest Lucas in 1912. The couple taught in Paris, Cicely working in the new Berlitz language school until the threat of war forced her and their young daughter to undertake a difficult and dangerous journey back to her family in Westwood Heath. Cicely commenced supply teaching to support herself. When Ernest returned after the war, the couple settled in Claverdon, and Cicely became headmistress of a girls\u2019 school in Solihull. In later life, Cicely became a local newspaper correspondent and a parish councillor, fiercely guarding rights of way in the parish. She also continued teaching children who needed extra support outside the classroom. Her mental faculties remained sharp, and she was active in public life up until her death in 1970 at the age of 91.
