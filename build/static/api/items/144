Dinah, who had been a woollen weaver, married Charles Connelly, a stone mason. They lived in the congested terraced housing of Halifax\u2019s industrial suburbs ~ in 1901 just off Queen\u2019s Road, and by 1911 at 22 Howard Street, by Pellon Lane. So Dinah lived at the heart of Halifax\u2019s nest of suffragettes. At New Year 1907, Dinah was among the 22 Halifax women who signed the ILP Manifesto to the WSPU. Then in February 1907, Dinah went down to London to take part in the WSPU\u2019s Women\u2019s Parliament; she was arrested ~ and sentenced to 14 days in prison. \r\n\r\nDinah Connelly complied with the 1911 census, Charles signed the household schedule, and all the information is provided. However, a closer look at Dinah\u2019s occupation reveals that it is given as \u2018slave\u2019 (the word is deleted, presumably by the census official). Why \u2018slave\u2019? It\u2019s easy to see. In 1911, Dinah\u2019s family consisted of herself, Charles (undoubtedly coming home with clothes covered in stone dust), and three sons, aged 9, 2 and 11 months. All five were squashed into a small 4-roomed terrace house. Domestic slavery indeed. Dinah's house is now demolished, but the photograph featured here is of similar houses that remain at the end of her street.\r\n\r\nOne of Dinah\u2019s younger children, Laura Mitchell, later became Mayor of Halifax ~ and has an impressive Laura Mitchell health centre named after her in the town centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "element_set": {"id": 3, "url": "/api/element_sets/3", "name": "Item Type Metadata", "resource": "element_sets"}, "element": {"id": 35, "url": "/api/elements/35", "name": "Biographical Text", "resource": "elements"}}], "extended_resources": []}
