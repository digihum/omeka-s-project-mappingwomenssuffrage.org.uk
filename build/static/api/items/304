The young Evelina was a keen horsewoman and in 1887 married Major Henry Haverfield, moved to Dorset, and had two sons. After her husband\u2019s death in 1895, she remarried, spending two years with her husband in South Africa founding a retirement camp for abandoned horses while her sister, a qualified doctor, investigated conditions in British concentration camps for a commission headed by Mrs Millicent Fawcett, later leader of the NUWSS. However, her second marriage was not a happy one. Evelina had kept the Haverfield name from her first marriage, and after returning to Dorset, the couple drifted apart. Evelina was likely a member of the local NUWSS branch in Dorset from the 1890s, but in 1908 switched allegiance to the WSPU. She gave generously to the society as well as donating to others and took part in varied suffrage events and activities. For instance, she was involved in the NUWSS caravan campaign in June 1909, where her horsemanship proved invaluable dealing with the caravan carthorses. Later that month, she was arrested after taking part in the WSPU deputation from Caxton Hall to the House of Commons and was defended by (see) Lord Robert Cecil (MLWS). In 1910, she was a mounted marshal for the WSPU processions on the 18th of June and 22nd of July; riding alongside (see) Vera Holme with whom she became romantically involved for the rest of her life. In November, she was arrested and charged with assaulting a policeman during the violent scuffles that broke out at a suffragette protest dubbed \u2018Black Friday\u2019. She was reported to have said about striking the policeman: \u2018It was not hard enough. Next time I will bring a revolver\u2019. Her fine was paid without her consent so she did not go to prison, but she did serve two weeks imprisonment shortly afterwards for attempting to break through a police cordon during a bout of window smashing following the government\u2019s torpedoing of the Conciliation bill. In 1914, Evelina left the WSPU and joined Sylvia Pankhurst\u2019s breakaway society the East London Federation of the WSPU becoming honorary treasurer, and later joined the United Suffragists. At the outbreak of War, she helped launch the Women\u2019s Emergency Corps; founded the Women\u2019s Volunteer Reserve becoming Commandant; served briefly as Commander-in-chief of the Women\u2019s Reserve Ambulance Corps (forerunner of the WAAC); and in 1915, spent two years in Serbia and Russia in charge of the transport column of the Scottish Women\u2019s Hospital to which Vera Holme belonged as driver and mechanic. In 1918, she co-founded with Flora Sandes a fund for promoting comforts for Serbian soldiers and prisoners and returned to Serbia to found an orphanage, dying shortly afterwards of pneumonia in 1920. Upon her death, Vera Holme became administrator of the fund and home Evelina had founded for Serbian orphans and was granted \u00a350 a year for life in Evelina\u2019s will. In 1929, a new health centre was built in Evelina\u2019s memory in Bajina Bashta, Serbia, where she is buried (see image), and a street has been dedicated to her.
