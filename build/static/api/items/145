Around her tenth birthday, she became a half-time tailoress in a local clothing factory, leaving school to work\r\nfull-time soon after. In the 1901 aged 19, she is recorded as working as a machinist fustian clothing tailoress, still in Hebden Bridge.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of Lavena\u2019s next five years. However, finding small-town Hebden Bridge restricting, in c. 1906 she moved up to more cosmopolitan Halifax, working as a weaver. Here there were more like-minded women in the Women\u2019s Labour League and in the WSPU. Living off Queens Road, Lavena found herself in the heart of Halifax\u2019s nest of suffragettes. \r\n\r\nIn March 1907, she went down to Westminster, was arrested ~ and imprisoned for 14 days. The next year, February 1908, she was again down in London, for the WSPU\u2019s Women\u2019s Parliament, was again arrested ~ and sentenced to 6 weeks.\r\n\r\nSuch harsh prison sentences inevitably took their toll. And from 1908, Lavena seemed to distance herself from WSPU militancy. In \u2018Suffragettes on the Tramp\u2019, she and Laura Wilson dressed in old clothes, walked the 25 miles to Wakefield to experience life as a tramp. And increasingly Lavena turned to the \u00a0new educational opportunities offered by the Workers\u2019 Education Association (WEA): she wanted to make up for her few years\u2019 schooling, cut so brutally short. Lavena now found her voice ~ and was soon writing her wonderful \u2018The Letters of a Tailoress\u2019 (The Highway, WEA), reflecting back on the confining horizons of her late-Victorian girlhood. Lavena had emerged as a talented writer.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn March 1911, when Emmeline Pankhurst came to Halifax and spoke on the census boycott at the Mechanics\u2019 Institute Hall, Lavena was probably sitting on the platform behind her. Three days later, on census night itself, she was undoubtedly an evader (from 13 Park Place, off Queens Road, where she was a boarder).\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn 1917, she married George Baker, a private soldier, at the Unitarian Chapel, Halifax ~ and they moved to Bradford. Sadly, Lavena fell into virtual obscurity for the next 40 years. She died in 1957 in Bradford, one of the \u2018the disappeared\u2019.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor more see, Liddington, Rebel Girls: their fight for the vote, Virago Press 2006 (includes selections from Lavena\u2019s writings).\r\n", "element_set": {"id": 3, "url": "/api/element_sets/3", "name": "Item Type Metadata", "resource": "element_sets"}, "element": {"id": 35, "url": "/api/elements/35", "name": "Biographical Text", "resource": "elements"}}], "extended_resources": []}
