When the 1894 Local Government Act gave propertied women the right to vote for and serve on local councils and as Poor Law Guardians, Marie became the first woman member of the new Uckfield Rural District Council and a Guardian of Uckfield Workhouse. In 1887, with Millicent Garrett Fawcett, Eva McLaren and Lady Frances Balfour, she formed the Liberal Women\u2019s Suffrage Society, and in 1907 she co-founded the Forward Suffrage Union to urge the Federation of Women Liberals Associations to adopt a definite women\u2019s suffrage policy. In 1911, following a meeting held by Lady Edith Fox-Pitt and Lady Queensberry, presided over by Lady Grove, chair of the Forward Suffrage Union, and addressed by Frances Balfour, Marie formed the East Grinstead Women\u2019s Suffrage Society (EGWSS) with herself as honorary secretary. Its President was Muriel, Countess de la Warr, and titled Vice-Presidents were: Muriel\u2019s sister-in-law Countess Sybil Brassey; Lady Fox-Pitt; Lady Eleanor Cecil of Chelwood Gate, whose husband, Lord Robert Cecil, was a founder member of the MLWS; Countess Munster of Maresfield Park; Countess Platen; and Lady Katherine Morgan of the Conservative Women\u2019s Franchise Association. A few months later Florence Buckley, EGWSS treasurer, chaired the first women\u2019s suffrage meeting ever to be held in Danehill itself. Miss Chute Ellis and Miss Spooner, of the Central Sussex Women\u2019s Suffrage Society, addressed an audience of 50-60, enlisting 12 new members. Cicely Corbett proposed the vote of thanks. In 1912 the EGWSS became affiliated to the Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire Federation of the NUWSS. With the escalation of WSPU violence that year, Marie, with other Sussex branch secretaries, wrote to the local press, denouncing WSPU militancy: \u2018There cannot be more than a few hundred who have put themselves under the leadership of the WSPU for the commission of lawless activities. The members of the East Grinstead Women\u2019s Suffrage Society strongly disapprove of acts of violence.\u2019 In July 1913 Marie arranged a public meeting on the eve of taking EGWSS members to join the Brighton Road contingent of Great Suffrage Pilgrimage to London. This descended into the \u2018East Grinstead Riot\u2019 when youths, recruited by \u2018anti\u2019 agents provocateurs, subjected EGWSS members and speakers, including Laurence Housman, a founder member of the MLWS, to noisy verbal abuse and unsavoury and injurious missiles. Undaunted, about 20 women set off the following morning to join the Brighton Road and Horsham contingents on their way from Crawley to Horley. From 1904 when Marie and her two daughters, Margery and Cicely, attended the first International Suffrage Congress, in Berlin, until 1921 when she took \u2018a large contingent of women from Danehill\u2019 to participate in the women\u2019s procession from the Embankment to the Albert Hall World Disarmament Conference, Marie campaigned on behalf of women at international as well as local level. Her obituary in the Mid Sussex Times detailed her involvement in community activity; International Women\u2019s Suffrage News eulogised her as \u2018one of our pioneers\u2019.
