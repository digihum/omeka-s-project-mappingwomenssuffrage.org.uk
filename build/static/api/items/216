She remained in Hereford for the rest of her life. One of four sisters - who apparently all played some part in the suffrage campaign - Beatrice was the leading light. She campaigned for women's suffrage locally, was an accomplished public speaker, and hand wrote all her speeches which are held in the Herefordshire Archives. She corresponded with well known figures of the movement such as the WSPU leader Mrs Emmeline Pankhurst and Gladice Keevil to help coordinate their visits to Hereford.  Beatrice was living with her family in 1911 and was included on the 1911 census form. However, this does not mean she necessarily wanted to comply given she was a WSPU member. The census form was completed and signed by her father who may have taken matters into his own hands. Source: Parlby Papers Collection, BH28, Herefordshire Archives & Records Centre.
