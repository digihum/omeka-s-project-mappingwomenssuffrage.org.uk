Her father died when she was aged 26. May was a teacher and worked in a private school. It seems that May moved to Nottingham in about 1901 where she worked for the Education Committee for twenty-nine years. She was involved with the NUWSS but became active in Nottingham's WSPU branch in about 1907 and was elected Honorary secretary in 1908 until a paid organiser Rachel Barrett was appointed later that year. May was present in London on 24th of February,1909, when (see) Helen Kirkpatrick Watts was arrested outside the House of Commons. She wrote to Helen warmly supporting her action, saying she had \u2018suffered terribly for the Cause\u2019 while May herself felt a 'desperate coward' as she had escaped the worst of the conflict. In April 1911, May evaded the government census survey as part of a wider suffragette boycott, but her mother and sisters Hannah and Kate and brother George, were home at 21 Chaucer Street - unfortunately no longer there. May went on to teach at Mundella Grammar School for some years becoming Head of the Clarendon School for Girls in 1925. She died at home at 4 Whittingham Road in Mapperley after a short illness. The Nottingham Evening Post reported her death and funeral which was attended by Aldermen, Councillors, and Education Committee members.
