Her mother and father, who was a coal merchant, were evidently prosperous in Charlotte\u2019s younger years employing a governess and three servants. However, by the mid-1870s they had fallen on harder times and her father\u2019s business was declared bankrupt. Consequently, it was important Charlotte found work and by 1891 she was teaching art at a boarding school in Saltburn, north Yorkshire. She later moved to London where between 1898-1910 she lived with suffragette Ethel Layton who in 1911 appeared in court with Marion Dunlop Wallace, for breaking two panes of glass at the Home Office. In 1911, Charlotte was lodging at 103 Hampstead Way and did not take part in the census boycott. She described herself as an \u2018artist illustrator etc\u2026magazines\u2026etc\u2026\u2019 It was likely for career purposes that she signed her artwork \u2018C. Hedley Charlton\u2019 (Hedley being her father\u2019s middle name) obscuring her gender and thus making her work more palatable to commissioning editors who were invariably men. By then, she was already a member and artist for the Artists Suffrage League formed in 1907, closely aligned with the law abiding NUWSS. Charlotte contributed to several jointly produced suffrage art works including illustrations for Cicely Hamilton\u2019s \u2018Beware! A Warning to Young Suffragists\u2019 published in 1908 and the 'ABC of Politics for Women Politicians\u2019 in 1909. She also produced individual post card designs for the ASL during these years including \u2018The Cry of the Children\u2019 and \u2018I Pray for all Grown Ups\u2019 available to view at The Women\u2019s Library, LSE, London. The ASL archive there also holds several draft sketches for postcards designed by Charlotte. Whether she produced further suffrage designs for the ASL after 1909 is uncertain but she continued to independently advertise suffrage cards and calendars in the NUWSS newspaper The Common Cause. One design she submitted to the NUWSS during the First World War was considered too \u2018wicked\u2019 by them. In it three children are peering over a wall with the message: \u2018When I an big I\u2019ll buy a gun, And so will Babs & Sue. We\u2019ll dead those Germans\u2026every one\u2026We\u2019ll dead the Kaiser too\u2019. Charlotte spent her last years living in Brighton close to one of her sisters. She died in 1945.
