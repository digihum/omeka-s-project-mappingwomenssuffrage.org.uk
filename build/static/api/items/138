Edwy Clayton\u2019s wife, Clara, and daughter, Hilda, were very active members of the WSPU and the Church League for Women\u2019s suffrage. In 1913 Clayton was suspected of providing materials to make explosives used in suffragette attacks on property. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison, went on hunger strike, and was eventually released under the Cat and Mouse Act. As a result of the prosecution his business was, apparently, ruined. Clayton belonged to the Men's League for Women's Suffrage and also the Men's Politcal Union (MPU). The Men's League was founded in 1907, 'with the object of bringing to bear upon the movement the electoral power of men... to obtain for women the vote on the same terms as which it is now, or may be in the future, be\u00a0granted to men'. The MPU founded in 1910 was a militant society - the male equivalent of the WSPU.
