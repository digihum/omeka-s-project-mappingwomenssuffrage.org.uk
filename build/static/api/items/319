His grandfather had been a Major-General in India and his father was a member of the Indian Civil Service.  \r\nBy 1894, Charles had married his wife Josephine and they had one son who was born in South Africa.  By 1901, the family had returned to Britain where the couple became active suffrage campaigners, with Charles belonging to the Men\u2019s League for Women\u2019s Suffrage and the Men\u2019s Political Union for Women\u2019s Enfranchisement (see separate entry for Josephine).  In 1910, the press reported Charles\u2019s arrest at the Black Friday demonstrations outside Parliament.  A policeman seized the woman accompanying Charles, to which he responded: \u2018You may take me, but you shall not take her.\u2019  He was accused of hitting a policeman, which he denied, and was discharged without evidence being offered.  In a later incident, Charles was badly hurt when stewards ejected him from a Liberal meeting, injuring his spine. In 1911, Charles\u2019s address on the electoral register was Fernshaw Mansions, Fernshaw Road, Chelsea, and the couple were active in the King\u2019s Road branch of the WSPU.  However, by the autumn they had moved to Sylvan Way, Bognor Regis, West Sussex continuing their campaigning (the map location is approximate).  In October, Josephine hosted an \u201cAt Home\u201d for a local suffrage society during which Charles spoke about his work for the Men\u2019s Committee for Justice to Women.  No record has been found of Charles, his wife or son in the 1911 census so it is possible that they evaded it. In 1913, Charles was arrested again for refusing to pay property taxes on behalf of his wife.  He was imprisoned in Lewes, East Sussex and went on hunger-strike.  He was released within 48 hours due to ill health and his name appears on the Roll of Honour of Suffragette Prisoners 1905-1914.  The Vote commented that \u201cThings have come to a pretty pass, when the only use England has for a courageous and honest gentleman is to break his back and fling him into prison.\u201d During this period, Charles was also on the Special Reserve list of army officers and in the First World War he was promoted to the rank of Major.  His son, Vere Carol Melvill Gonne (1895-1961), supported his parent\u2019s campaigning and continued the family\u2019s military tradition by joining the Royal Garrison Artillery.
