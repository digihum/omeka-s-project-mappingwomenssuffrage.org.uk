This information was published in The Common Cause, 4 July 1913 as part of promoting the NUWSS pilgrimage from Kent to London. Her co-Honorary Secretary was Marjorie Crombie-Hill (see her entry). Mary lived in a grand mansion: her father, William, had made his fortune from the wool trade in Australia. Bulimba was a large, grand, neo-Jacobean mansion built of ragstone in 22 acres next to St Mary\u2019s Church in Kippington in 1890. Demolished in 1933, the land was sub-divided into 9 plots fronting Kippington Road and 11 fronting Oakhill Road. Mary is referenced in the newspaper reports of the Sevenoaks 1913 pilgrimage meetings alongside Australian actress and well-known women\u2019s suffrage speaker, Muriel Matters. Muriel had been a founder member of the Women\u2019s Freedom League (WFL), but in 1913 had left the WFL and joined the NUWSS. Mary is referenced in a local newspaper article where she, Marjorie Crombie-Hill and Mrs Percy Thompson, were congratulated for their arrangements for the arrival to Sevenoaks of the pilgrimage. In 1939, Mary still lived in Sevenoaks but at The Lodge, Bradbourne Road and her occupation was listed as \u2018historical research work\u2019. She never married.  She died in 1950.
