Marie played a central role in founding the Coventry Women's Suffrage Society (CWSS) - the local branch of the law abiding NUWSS - by inviting and hosting a meeting for the latter in Coventry in 1909 from which a preliminary Coventry committee was formed. At the beginning of 1910, the CWSS was officially founded with Marie acting as literature secretary. Afterwards, she hosted a series of follow up meetings and 'at homes' at St. Gilgen often with her sister in law (see) Edith White helping the Coventry Society grow in its early years. Marie seems to have been most comfortable as a facilitator rather than as a speaker, but was ever present throughout the campaign. She was an avid supporter of Coventry and District Nursing Association and numerous children's welfare charities. In 1920, she left Coventry for a time to work in the Tyrol, Austria, for Coventry's Save the Children and Famine Relief Fund. Researcher: Tara Morton.
