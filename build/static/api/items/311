As leader of the Catholic feminist organisation the St Joan\u2019s Social & Political Alliance she championed women\u2019s rights within the Catholic Church.  She was born in Birkenhead on 14th May 1885 to Frances and Zacharie Barry (Bahri). Often described as a Persian immigrant, Zacharie was born in Smyrna (modern day Izmir, Turkey) and referred to himself as a Naturalised British Subject. Mr. Barry was a successful fruit merchant, specialising in the import and export of sultanas. Sources refer to Florence\u2019s mother Frances as a charity worker of Austrian heritage. Florence\u2019s baptism record is not available online but considering her later career and that her older siblings were baptised in a Liverpool Catholic church, it is reasonable to assume that Florence was baptised a Catholic. In 1901 Florence was attending the Convent School for Young Ladies in Upton, Wirral. The origins of Florence\u2019s suffrage campaigning are unclear, but she was first a member of the Women\u2019s Social & Political Union (WSPU) possibly affiliated with the Birkenhead branch. Initially, she did not see the need for a separate suffrage society for Catholic women, but by 1912, her view had changed, and she became a member of the Catholic Women\u2019s Suffrage Society (CWSS). The CWSS, founded in March 1911, was initially a London organisation but quickly grew, and Liverpool was one its first \u2018provincial\u2019 branches. Despite then belonging to the WSPU, Florence complied with the 1911 Census (see image). Was Florence\u2019s compliance the start of her shift away from the WSPU? Possibly, but allegiance to the WSPU did not guarantee a boycott of the census. For example, celebrated Liverpool suffragette (see) Patricia Woodlock who was arrested and imprisoned several times did not take part in the boycott either. Interestingly, Patricia also had links to Liverpool CWSS, so perhaps the women\u2019s decision to comply was influenced by their religious affiliations? By 1913, Florence was Honorary Secretary of Liverpool CWSS and in 1915 joined the CWSS National Executive Committee. By 1919, she was leading the society under its new name the St Joan\u2019s Alliance. Under her leadership the organisation flourished becoming a powerful Catholic feminist group. Florence was also a founding member of the Open-Door Council and in 1927, co-signed a letter to The Times newspaper supporting the vote for women over the age of 21. In recognition for her hard work and dedication Florence was awarded \u201c'Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice' by the Catholic Church in 1951.
