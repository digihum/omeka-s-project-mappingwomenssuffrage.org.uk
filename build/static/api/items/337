After divorcing Gilbert Sackville, Earl de la Warr, in 1902, Muriel took up residence at Old Lodge on Ashdown Forest. In March 1911 she donated to WSPU funds and sent to the Bexhill Chronicle the WSPU\u2019s reply to Winston Churchill\u2019s attack on it, protesting particularly about the force-feeding of men suffrage activists. At this time Muriel was staying with her friend, American heiress Mary Hoadley Dodge, at Warwick House, St James, where she and her maid are listed as visitors in the 1911 Census. In April 1911 Muriel presided, supported by Louisa Martindale, at a Horsted Keynes meeting, attended by a \u2018large, fashionable and enthusiastic audience\u2019, and addressed by Lord Robert Cecil. In the Coronation Procession of 17th June she accompanied Millicent Garrett Fawcett and her entourage. In the autumn of 1911 Muriel became President of the East Grinstead Women\u2019s Suffrage Society formed by Marie Corbett. Vice-Presidents included Lady Sybil Brassey, the second wife of Muriel\u2019s father, and Lady Eleanor Cecil. Meanwhile Muriel and Lady Betty Balfour, President of the Conservative Women\u2019s Franchise Association, had been \u2018working indefatigably\u2019 to make Emmeline Pankhurst\u2019s tour of the Highlands \u2018a great success\u2019. As Betty Balfour said, presiding over Lady Cowdray\u2019s \u2018At Home\u2019 at Dunecht House, \u2018Now that the Government has promised facilities for the Conciliation Bill, all suffrage societies are working heart and soul together\u2019. In November 1911 Muriel chaired a WSPU meeting in South Kensington, addressed by Elizabeth Robins and Evelyn Sharp. In February 1912 she was on the platform at a NUWSS Albert Hall event presided over by Millicent Garrett Fawcett and addressed by Lloyd George, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Betty Balfour\u2019s brother Lord Lytton, chair of the Conciliation Committee. A meeting chaired by Muriel at Brockenhurst Ladies College, Seaford, resulted in the formation of a NUWSS branch there. In November, now President also of the Rotherfield and Mark Cross Women\u2019s Suffrage Society, Muriel attended another NUWSS public meeting in the Albert Hall where one of the speakers was Lord Robert Cecil. For the Midlothian by-election in September 1912, Muriel, a committee member of the NUWSS Election Fighting Fund, lent at least one car to the suffrage-supporting Labour Party. She similarly supported George Lansbury when, in November 1912, he resigned his seat of Bow and Bromley in order to force a by-election and stood independently as a Socialist Women\u2019s Suffragist. In January 1913 Muriel became President of the new Federated Council of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies, comprising 18 non-militant suffrage organisations, and run under the auspices of the National Political League. She participated in a National Political League demonstration in March, and conference in April, calling upon the Government to stop this \u2018barbarous custom of forcible feeding\u2019. She was a signatory of protests against the Cat and Mouse Act, and in May 1913 was one of the few women to attend the Bow St trial of seven WSPU officials WSPU, including Beatrice Sanders, and two men. Muriel and Mary Dodge were thanked for supplying cars for the NUWSS Pilgrimage in July 1913, and, in September, Muriel\u2019s \u2018large and comfortable motor car\u2019 made Lady Frances Balfour and her companions \u2018independent of the vagaries of Highland trains\u2019, on their campaigning tour of Scotland. In 1917 Muriel joined the National Council for Adult Suffrage, and in the December 1918 General Election supported Major Graham-Pole, Labour candidate for the East Grinstead Division, whose publicity gave as the ninth of ten reasons for voting for him that \u2018he stands for equal rights for men and women\u2019.
