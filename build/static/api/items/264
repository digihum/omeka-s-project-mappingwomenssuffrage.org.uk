She became a practised stage performer through contributing songs to concerts at the Congregational Hall, built by veteran suffragist Louisa Martindale, in nearby Horsted Keynes. After graduating from Somerville College, Oxford, in 1907, and as secretary of her mother\u2019s Forward Suffrage Union in the Women\u2019s Liberal Association, Cicely became much in demand as a speaker all over the country, both to explain the Forward Suffrage Union to WLA branches and to talk on behalf of the NUWSS. In 1909, she took the stage in Cardiff while friend (see) Helga Gill, a Norwegian suffragist, was spending a month as NUWSS organiser there, and joined in the NUWSS Scottish Highlands Campaign, chairing a meeting at Kingussie. In Sussex that year she spoke to the Haywards Heath and Lindfield Women Liberals Association and to the Brighton and Hove Women\u2019s Franchise Society. Cicely participated in Men\u2019s League for Women\u2019s Suffrage (MLWS) rallies in Trafalgar Square and was regularly paired with a MLWS speaker, for example Laurence Housman, to speak at open-air meetings throughout Greater London. In 1909, the International Women\u2019s Franchise Club was formed, under the auspices of the/MLWS, with Cicely its \u2018indefatigable\u2019 secretary. Cicely also spoke in company with Millicent Garrett Fawcett, on one occasion singing the suffrage version of Hope and Glory. Speaking tours took her to Ireland in 1911 and again, with Helga Gill, in 1912. She describes her occupation on the 1911 census as (see) \u2018Suffrage lecturer\u2019. Having first gone to Hungary in 1910 to help organise suffrage groups there, she returned, as the recently-married Cecily Corbett Fisher, for the IWSA Congress in Budapest in June 1913 where, as \u2018a great favourite\u2019, she drew huge audiences. In London, Cicely was a member of the executive committee of the East St Pancras NUWSS, and on the general committee of the Actresses\u2019 Franchise League. She did not neglect Sussex, however, speaking at meetings at Arundel, the tiny village of Slaugham, Rotherfield, and Uckfield, as well as at Horsted Keynes and Danehill. Reflecting the Corbett family\u2019s commitment to disarmament, Cicely reported on the first Peace Study Conference, in Amsterdam, held following the decision taken at the 1926 Conference of the International Alliance for Suffrage and Equal Citizenship to study \u2018Peace questions\u2019. She departed from family tradition in becoming \u2018an ardent supporter of the Labour movement\u2019: in November 1928, as secretary of the Advisory Committee on Finance and Commerce for the National Labour Party, she addressed a Cuckfield Labour Party meeting in the Queen\u2019s Hall on \u2018Disarmament and Peace\u2019. In September 1933, at an East Grinstead Labour Party Fete and Rally in Elm Hall garden, she chaired a talk by \u2018Manny\u2019 Shinwell. The subject of a talk by Cicely at the Danehill Women\u2019s Institute in March 1935 was \u2018Current Events\u2019, and in 1936 she urged both the Danehill and the Horsted Keynes WI to join the League of Nations Union. \u2018As responsible citizens they should not only look upon the light and pleasant side of life.\u2019 Contributed by independent researcher and writer, Frances Stenlake.
